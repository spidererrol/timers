# TO DO LIST

This I want to achieve in this project:

    [ ] Alarm after each stage
    [ ] Adjustable default length for timers
    [ ] Ability to set timers as either (hours):minutes:seconds or just seconds >= 60.
    [ ] Edit default & final colours
        [ ] Should default and/or final colours be per-stage?

## DONE

    [X] Flexible number of timers (add & remove timers)
    [X] Manually (quickly) adjust to a different start point (time left).
    [X] Highlight timers when they get below a (settable) threshold time.
    [X] Multi-stage timers (eg main time, alarm, then cooldown, alarm)
    [X] Quick reset-and-restart for each timer.
