# TO DO LIST

This I want to achieve in this project:

* [ ] Adjustable default length for timers
* [ ] Ability to set timers as either (hours):minutes:seconds or just seconds >= 60.
* [ ] Edit default & final colours
    * [ ] Should default and/or final colours be per-stage?

## Bonus items

* [ ] Display a real time clock on screen.
    * [ ] Real time alarms?

## DONE

* [X] Flexible number of timers (add & remove timers)
* [X] Manually (quickly) adjust to a different start point (time left).
* [X] Highlight timers when they get below a (settable) threshold time.
* [X] Multi-stage timers (eg main time, alarm, then cooldown, alarm)
* [X] Quick reset-and-restart for each timer.
* [X] Alarm after each stage
* [X] Add sliders to edit colours ~~instead of~~ <u>as well as</u> NumberScrollers
