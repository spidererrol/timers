# TODO

This I want to achieve in this project:

[ ] Flexible number of timers (add & remove timers)
[ ] Adjustable default length for timers
[ ] Manually (quickly) adjust to a different start point (time left).
[ ] Quick reset-and-restart for each timer.
[ ] Ability to set timers as either (hours):minutes:seconds or just seconds >= 60.
[ ] Highlight timers when they get below a (settable) threshold time.
[ ] Multi-stage timers (eg main time, alarm, then cooldown, alarm)
